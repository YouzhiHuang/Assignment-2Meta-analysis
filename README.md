# Assignment-2Meta-analysis-of-Ocean-Acidification-Effects-on-Behaviour
**The goal of this assignment is to conduct a meta-analysis on ocean acidification effects on behaviour**
## **Load the necessary R Packages**

## **Add the article by [Clark et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1903-y) to the Meta-analysis dataset**

### 1. Analysis of [Clark et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1903-y) for each of the fish species’ `average activity` for each treatment.

### 2. Merge the summary statistics generated from from [Clark et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1903-y) with the metadata

### 3. Merge metadata from larger meta-analysis datase

## **Meta-analytical model for ocean acidification metadata sets**

### 4. Calculate the log response ratio (lnRR) effect size for every row

### 5. Meta-analytic model fitted to the data

### 6. Results and discussion of the meta-analytical model

#### Uncertainty in the overall meta-analysis mean: 95% confidence interval:

#### Heterogeneity in effect size estimates across studies：

#### Forest plot to capture meta-analysis model results.

## **Publication biases in meta-analyses of ocean acidification metadata sets**

### 7. Funnel plot for visually assessing the possibility of publication bias  

### 8. Time-lag plot assessing how effect sizes may or may not have changed through time.

### 9. Formal meta-regression model that includes year as a moderator (fixed effect) to test for time-lag bias

### 10 Formal meta-regression model that includes inverse sampling variance (i.e., 1vlnRR) to test for file-drawer biases

### 11 Discussion of the possibility of publication bias based on meta-regression results

### 12 Discuss publication bias with reference to the study by [Clements et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001511)
